# A4: Fritter Visual

Implement the good practice visual UI aspects into your `Fritter` in its entirety. Must support `Upvoting`, `Following`, and `Refreeting`.
There is no starter code because we expect you to copy over the files from the previous assignment.


**Please remember to copy over** `.gitignore` so you don't push `node_modules` to your repo.

## Partners
You and your partner should discuss each others' implementations of the previous assignment and decide on which parts of them you will draw from. You do not need to use the code of only one partner or the other; in fact, ideally you will select the best parts of each to build on.
